"This is my number one destination for presents - really, unique special presents that people are thrilled to receive.",Joy,Trust

This is not a large commercial spa where you feel that you are one of a large number being churned through a myriad of 'spa experiences'.,Surprise,
"This is NOT a spa, it is a hotel with a small pool and does not offer the relaxing spa experience that it promises.",Anger,
"This is our second holiday with Pure Leisure, and we would not hesitate to use them again - the standards of both sites have been very high, and we had a lovely time.",Joy,
This is such a hideous depiction I suppose it gave the scorned wife some satisfaction.,Anger,
This is supposed to be an award winning coach company but the management system falls way below standard.,Disgust,
"This is the capital of England's zoo, what a waste of a day and a hell of a lot of money.",Anger,
This is the first review I have felt compelled to write as a result of an awful trip to Whipsnade Zoo today.,Anger,
